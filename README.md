An online Js Paint app
Hi , I decided to create a light weight paint app using js that work's with touch devices and uses touch pressure to adjust pen size using Touch Events API.
But there is a problem with painting yet. When using light pen instead of mouse, pen movement is detected late and it causes the app not be able to draw tiny curvatures with pen. can anybody help please?
